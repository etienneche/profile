      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Since as long that I remember, I always've been interesting about traveling.
      When I got 19 years old I jump in the first train which bring me to the border of Switzerland,
      where I stayed for 2years learning how to live by myself.
      Really fast I understood that I was a sunny people so I took a plane for warmer countries where i discover the nomad life style.
      I basically stay stuck on this life style for the following 5 years.
      I travelled in few different country in Oceania, Asia, Europe, South America and Middle East
      (between backpack, vans, hitchiking, trekking).
     Whatever the way travelling is the best school.</p>

      <h3>Plans</h3>
      <p>After this time on the road, I often had the opportunity to meet
      a lot of crazy folk which was living out of rules on their own way.
      Those years teach me a lot about peoples and about myself.
      I always been a nature lover and really attract about the lifestyle of tribe peoples from who I got inspired in Australia (Aborigenes).
      I plan in the next 2 years to visit as much communities that already took an alternative way of consumption cause some good ideas are there.
      Today I'm doing a coding school on the goal to in the future be able to link all those who decide to do things locally.
      And why not maybe spread the word one day to kids for learn them hom to became healthy mind in healthy body full of creativity and ambitions
      to protect what we should all take care about a bit more: <br> NATURE</p>
